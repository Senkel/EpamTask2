As Facebook executives faced, congressional scrutiny over how Russia might have abused its social network, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company is going to put its 2 billion users ahead of profit, and that beefing up its security will cut into earnings?

He made that statement on Wednesday as Facebook, one of the biggest advertising operations in the world, reported sales and profit that blew past Wall Street estimates.

"I am dead serious about this," Zuckerberg said on a conference call with analysts. He said Facebook will hire an additional 10,000 people to its security teams to prevent abuse on its platform, though not all of them will be full-time employees. The move, he said, will impact the company's profitability. "I wanted our investors to hear that directly from me."

"I've expressed how upset I am that the Russians tried to use our tools to sow mistrust," Zuckerberg continued. "What they did is wrong and we are not going to stand for it."

His statements came after two congressional hearings that morning, where Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch attempted to defend the world's largest social network from lawmakers looking for who to blame for Russia's meddling in last year's bitter election. 

The hearings underscore how much Silicon Valley has had to reckon with its massive power. The tech giants, and their almighty algorithms, essentially have the ability to decide whatever people see when they visit their sites. For Facebook, that means controlling what the 2 billion people who use it every month see on their news feeds. The increased prodding from the federal government means the looming possibility of regulation.
